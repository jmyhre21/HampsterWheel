# HampsterWheel
## Goal
Make a car drive in a wheel, and possibly make it faster, and or make it so when you push the button it keeps going and then you press it again it stops.

## Psudo code
/*
Servo library stuff
Stuff for one button and one potentiometer
*/

void setup() {
    // turn on button servo and potentiometer
}

void loop() {
    // read the button
    
    // button toggle code
   // https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/switch
    // first time the button is pressed spin the wheel
    // potentiometer control servo speed
    
    // second time the button is pressed stop spin
}

## Overveiw
### what did we accomplish
we made a spinning wheel that you can put a car in it and it will roll
### are we on track
we have completed the assignment and submitted it
### what progress have we made
we have made the stand better by having it use less materials and you can now see what is happening in the wheel
### what do we have to do next
we have to mount the servo and put the new stands on
### how is it going
we are done and good
### major obsticles
putting it together
### When I return from Spring break, the first thing I'm going to do is print out the things and put them together
